Todo:
-implement reinforcements
	-fix the damn fringe....
	-define defensiveScoreToReinforce
	-define offensiveScoreToReinforce
-implement solidifyChainReinforcementMoves
	-define the function
	-define the functions in the function.
-consider attacking algorithms... either the pair thing, or further.
(try and do this progressively.)


Not sure:
-change nicestPlanets to nicestMoves
-add in myNicestPlanets to sort and help choose the planet in my latest bot.

Done:
-fill in prototypes and cull old ones.
-cull out unused codethat will never be used.
-turn nicestPlanets into a class, with an empty functor, and a 
	constructor that takes all of the regular parameters.
	_bestRecursive will obviously also be in this class with the cache
	global variables.
-clean up code.
	-clean up nicestPlanets
	-clean up _bestRecursive
	-finish cleaning up AITools.h
	-finish cleaning up GeneralTools.h
	-create a new bot name called cleanedup.cc and clean the code up in it.
-fix getPotentialCost... have it act more like doDefence I believe.
	-so check each turn, who would own the planet. This gives a MUCH
		more accurate representation.
		(this is actually causing me to send WAY more ships than i need.)
-nicestPlanets should reutnr a move list maybe.
-add in doing nicest for all planets and choosing the highest xTurnBenefit pairs to do.
-implement reinforcements
	-define regular getReinforcementMoves
	-define updatePlanetsByMove
	-define getNotFringePlanets
	-define closestToReinforce
	-compile, and test.
	-getReinforcementMoves should take a list of safe planets.
