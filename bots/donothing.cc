// The DoTurn function is where your code goes. The PlanetWars object contains
// the state of the game, including information about all planets and fleets
// that currently exist. Inside this function, you issue orders using the
// pw.IssueOrder() function. For example, to send 10 ships from planet 3 to
// planet 8, you would say pw.IssueOrder(3, 8, 10).
//
// There is already a basic strategy in place here. You can use it as a
// starting point, or you can throw it out entirely and replace it with your
// own. Check out the tutorials and articles on the contest website at
